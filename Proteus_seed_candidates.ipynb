    "## 1. Lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) - 12,300 results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural Complexity**: Lipases typically have an α/β hydrolase fold and are often monomeric, but some can form oligomers. They may exhibit interfacial activation, where a lid domain covers the active site, complicating modeling efforts.\n",
